Google  was  founded by  Larry  Page  and Sergey  Brin   while they   were    Ph.D.
students at Stanford
University,
California.
Together,  they  own
about 14 percent  of
its    shares    and
control  56  percent
of  the  stockholder
voting power through
supervoting   stock.
They    incorporated
Google     as      a
privately       held
company on September
4, 1998. An  initial
public      offering
(IPO) took place  on
August 19, 2004, and
Google moved to  its
new headquarters  in
Mountain    
  View,
California,
nicknamed        the
Googleplex.

In   August    2015,
Google     announced
plans to  reorganize
its interests  as  a
holding      company
called Alphabet Inc.
When            this
restructuring   took
place on October  2,
2015, Google  became
Alphabet's   leading
subsidiary, as  well
as  the  parent  for
Google's    Internet
interests.
